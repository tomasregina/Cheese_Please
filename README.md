> Simple web game using face-api.js

# IMPORTANT

> In order to run this app, you need to download face-api.js models (https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js-models) and run custom server (e.g. with http-server -cors util through terminal) to serve weights

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
